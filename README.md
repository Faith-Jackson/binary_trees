# 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and manipulating binary trees in C. It is part of the C programming series, emphasizing algorithms and data structures.

## Project Details
- **Type**: Group project
- **Weight**: 5
- **Team Members**: Anieyie Asuquo, Faith Jackson
- **Start Date**: June 3, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date**: June 7, 2024, 6:00 AM

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:
- Understand what a binary tree is.
- Distinguish between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Explain the time complexity advantages of binary trees over linked lists.
- Define the depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
- Perform different tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- Identify complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.

- **Code Style**: Follow the Betty coding style (checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)
- **File Endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **Global Variables**: Not allowed
- **Function Limit**: No more than 5 functions per file
- **Standard Library Usage**: Allowed
- **Header File**: All function prototypes should be included in `binary_trees.h`
- **Include Guards**: All header files should be include guarded

## GitHub Repository
- One repository per group.
- Cloning/forking/creating a project repository with the same name before the second deadline may result in a 0% score.

## Task List
1. **Binary Tree Node**: Create a new binary tree node.
2. **Insert Left**: Insert a node as the left-child of another node.
3. **Insert Right**: Insert a node as the right-child of another node.
4. **Delete**: Delete an entire binary tree.
5. **Is Leaf**: Check if a node is a leaf.
6. **Is Root**: Check if a node is the root.
7. **Pre-order Traversal**: Traverse a tree using pre-order.
8. **In-order Traversal**: Traverse a tree using in-order.
9. **Post
